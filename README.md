How to Deploy with GitHub Pages
Since this is a single-file application, it is perfectly suited for static hosting services like GitHub Pages.

Create a Repository: If you haven't already, create a new public GitHub repository. You can name it something like the-tech-adviser.

Rename the file: Rename your main HTML file to index.html. This is a crucial step, as GitHub Pages looks for a file with this name to serve as the homepage.

Upload the file: Upload the index.html file to the root of your new repository.

Enable GitHub Pages:

Go to the Settings tab of your repository.

In the left-hand sidebar, click on Pages.

Under the "Branch" section, select main (or the branch where you uploaded your file) and click Save.

Access Your Site: After a few minutes, GitHub will build and deploy your site. You will see a link at the top of the "Pages" section with your live URL (e.g., https://yourusername.github.io/your-repository-name).

How to Monetize
The application is built to be monetized through affiliate marketing.

Join Affiliate Programs: Sign up for affiliate programs with major retailers like Amazon Associates, Best Buy, or Newegg.

Generate Links: Once approved, generate your unique affiliate links for the recommended products (e.g., the LG C4 TV, the MacBook Air, etc.).

Replace Placeholders: Open the index.html file and search for the affiliateLink property within the mockData object. Replace the placeholder URLs with your actual affiliate links.

Example: Change "https://www.example.com/lg-c4-affiliate-link" to "https://www.amazon.com/dp/your-specific-code".

By following these steps, you can get your website up and running quickly.
